# traumar (development version)

- **New Platform Support**: Added the `traumar` .NET Framework 4.7.2 class library (`dotnet/Traumar.NET/`). This NuGet-ready library provides strongly-typed C# implementations of the R package's core features, including survival probability (TRISS), Relative Mortality Measure (RMM), Non-linear bins algorithm, trauma performance (W/M/Z-scores), and all 13 SEQIC quality indicators. Features 100% logic parity and an extensive xUnit test suite.

# traumar 1.2.4
- Added the functions to perform all data validation. These functions take the
  form of `validate_*()`, such as `validate_character_factor()`. After exploring
  options from other packages to lean on existing methods to validate data via
  functional programming, the decision was made to create functions "in-house"
  to avoid issues with adding another dependency. The `validate_*()` family of
  functions is not exported from `traumar`.

- Updated unit tests throughout the package given the addition of new data
  validation methodology.

- Ensured that plenty of comments are provided throughout the functions in the
  package to enhance understanding of the code and collaboration.

- `pretty_number()` now uses a `digits` argument instead of `n_decimal`.
  `n_decimal` has been deprecated and will now issue a warning, but the function
  will still work using the `n_decimal` argument. In a later release,
  `n_decimal` will be fully deprecated.

- `rmm()` and `rm_bin_summary()` will now fail if the `seed` argument is not of
  class numeric or integer.

- Added section headers throughout the code base to make navigation within most
  modern IDEs easier.

- Error/warning messages will now directly name the function in the call stack
  that is most helpful. For example, if some data validation triggers an error
  within `traumar::seqic_indicator1()`, then `traumar::seqic_indicator1()` will
  show up in the error message, instead of some other function such as a `cli`
  function or one of the new `validate_*()` functions.

- Improved `small_count_label()` code readability in the control flow chunk
  where values less than the cutoff are manipulated depending on user input.

- `trauma_performance()` now acts as a wrapper for `trauma_case_mix()` as
  `trauma_performance()` now calls `trauma_case_mix()` under the hood instead of
  explicitly performing the same operations. This makes the functionality more
  maintainable for any future iterations.

# traumar 1.2.3
- `probability_of_survival()` was updated to enhance code readability and
  leverage mathematical notation in the calculation of predicted survival
  probabilities. The function now aligns with the coefficients published in
  Norouzi et al. (2013) and Merchant et al. (2023). Consistent with Boyd et al.
  (1987), the function does not treat patients under 15 years of age differently
  and accounts for penetrating injuries similarly to other age groups. This
  update ensures a standardized approach to calculating survival probabilities
  for both blunt and penetrating traumas.

- From this release forward, all development of `traumar` will be done in the
  IDE Positron!

# traumar 1.2.2

- `rmm()`, `rm_bin_summary()`, and `nonlinear_bins()`: Updated the documentation
  for the threshold arguments along with the divisor arguments. These were
  updated along with the Details section of the `nonlinear_bins()` function
  documentation to provide a better explanation of the binning algorithm under
  the hood.

- `probability_of_survival()`: Updated the Return section documentation to be
  more accurate that the output is not a percentage, it is the predicted
  probability of survival on a scale from 0 to 1. A previous version of this
  function was multiplied by 100 to seem more like a percentage.


# traumar 1.2.1

- Within the `trauma_performance()` function, renamed the variable
  `predicted_prob_death` to `scale_factor` which is commensurate with the source
  literature.

- updated comments in `trauma_performance()` for `z_method` method of the
  `Z_score` to reflect the right text. 

- In `trauma_performance()`, completed the comment where the `scale_factor` is
  created so that it is complete and clear. 

- Corrected a test error at CRAN from using bootstrap CI process in testing with
  100,000 observations and 100 bootstrap samples to make sure `rmm()` and
  `rm_bin_summary()` ran in under 60 sec. That test now does not use the
  bootstrap process so the core function can be tested and will always run in
  under a minute with 100,000 observations. 

- Cleaned up other tests within for relative_mortality.R that were checking for
  correct error / warning handling where multiple lines of output were sent to
  the console. Built a custom function to deal with those scenarios and
  correctly perform those unit tests. 

# traumar 1.2.0

- This minor release introduces functionality to demonstrate how the Iowa trauma
  system currently engages in the quality improvement process using the System
  Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee (SEQIC) Indicators.

- Added a [Contributor Code of
  Conduct](https://bemts-hhs.github.io/traumar/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and support
  information.

- Additionally, a convenience function `is_it_normal()` provides the ability for
  users of `traumar` to get descriptive statistics on one or more numeric
  variables, with optional normality tests, and diagnostic plots (for one
  variable only). Grouping functionality is also supported in `is_it_normal()`
  to conduct exploratory data analysis of one or more variables within zero or
  more groups. 

- Added the following functions:
  - `seqic_indicator_1()`
  - `seqic_indicator_2()`
  - `seqic_indicator_3()`
  - `seqic_indicator_4()`
  - `seqic_indicator_5()`
  - `seqic_indicator_6()`
  - `seqic_indicator_7()`
  - `seqic_indicator_8()`
  - `seqic_indicator_9()`
  - `seqic_indicator_10()`
  - `seqic_indicator_11()`
  - `seqic_indicator_12()`
  - `seqic_indicator_13()`
  - `is_it_normal()`
- A fix was applied to `nonlinear_bins()` to make the `percent` column calculate
  correctly when groups were not introduced.

- Removed hard-coded rounding from most calculations within the package where
  possible.

- Improved examples for the the package's README, `probability_of_survival()`,
  `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and `rm_bin_summary()` using more helpful data.

- Improved error messages coming from `nonlinear_bins()` when the argument
  `Ps_col` does not follow the expected distribution of the calculated
  probability of survival, and/or a sample size too small to calculate bins is
  passed to the function, including when passed to `rmm()` and
  `rm_bin_summary()`.

- Code formatting changed to the `air` package through the RStudio IDE.
- Updated data validation for `trauma_case_mix()`, `trauma_performance()`,
  `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and `rm_bin_summary()` to provide improved
  messaging related to missings in `Ps_col` and `outcome_col` .

- Across functions using the probability of survival calculation, it is expected
  that Ps values have a range of [0, 1].  Functions will no longer handle values
  in percentage format (e.g. 10, 50, 98).

- The `outcome` argument was removed from `trauma_performance()` to remove
  ambiguity in the nature of the `outcome_col` values. Only values of
  `TRUE/FALSE` and `1/0` are accepted.

- The `diagnostics` argument was removed from `trauma_performance()` to make the
  user interface smoother.  Instead of providing guidance via outputs to the
  console, users are encouraged to seek assistance with interpreting results via
  the source academic literature and the package documentation.

- `trauma_performance()` will no longer provide a pivoted output as a default.
  Users can elect to pivot the outputs as needed in their workflows.

- `rmm()` and `rm_bin_summary()` now have a new argument `bootstrap_ci` that
  allows a user to elect to use the bootstrap CIs, or not.  `bootstrap_ci`
  defaults to `TRUE` in order to better support backward compatibility.


# traumar 1.1.0

## New Features

- Added optional grouping functionality to `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and
  `rm_bin_summary()`.
  
  - Setting `group_vars = NULL` applies the functions to the entire dataset
    without subgrouping.
    
  - For pivoting the `rmm()` outputs longer, setting `pivot = TRUE` will work
    when `group_vars` is invoked by pivoting longer with the grouping context.


## Enhancements

- Improved `NA` handling in `rmm()` and `rm_bin_summary()`.  

- Ensured RMM calculations remain within the expected range of [-1 to 1],
  including their 95% confidence intervals.   

- Optimized `nonlinear_bins()` by replacing its internal `for` loop with `dplyr`
  functions, enhancing accuracy and efficiency without introducing breaking
  changes. 

- Improved command line messaging and documentation within `rmm()` and
  `rm_bin_summary()` regarding probability of survival values `Ps_col < 0` and
  `Ps_col > 1`.  Now, these functions will throw an error if probability of
  survival values are `Ps_col < 0` or `Ps_col > 1`. 

- The `nonlinear_bins()` function has improved data validation for the `Ps_col`
  variable.
